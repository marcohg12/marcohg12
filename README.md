Hi! I'm Marco Herrera, a Computing Engineering Undergraduate at Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica. I am a passionate developer with a keen interest in both web development and low-level programming.

I specialize in building dynamic web applications using React, Node.js, and Express. I enjoy creating clean, efficient, well-documented, and scalable full-stack projects. I also love working with C for low-level projects, where I optimize performance and interact closely with hardware to build systems that are both efficient and robust.
